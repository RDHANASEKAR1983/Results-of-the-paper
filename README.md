Performance Enhancement of Permanent Magnet DC Motor with SEPIC Converter through Higher-order Sliding surface

 Abstractâ€” The primary concern of this article is to stabilize the rotating speed of a permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor driven by a DC-DC SEPIC converter under 
 mismatched disturbances via a higher order PID sliding surface (PIDSS) controller. This controller offers numerous benefits, including robustness, enhanced control performance, 
 flexibility, simple implementation, and low cost. An algorithm for the above-mentioned control is developed to handle various load torques, including no-load, constant, frictional, 
 and propeller types. Furthermore, the features of PIDSS are compared with classical sliding surface, sliding mode control (SMC) and proportional integral controller (PIC) by taking 
 into consideration peak overshoot, steady-state error and settling time. Both simulation and experimental results are obtained satisfactorily.

A) For constant load torque condition
1.	Open the simulation file SepicCLT.slx through MATLAB
2.	Run the file for 11 seconds
3.	open the scope (SPEED PROFILE) which is highlighted in GREEN colour (Fig.3.)
4.	open the scope (LOAD TORQUE PROFILE) which is highlighted in BLUE colour (Fig.4.)
5.	open the scope (COMBINED SPEED) which is highlighted in ORANGE colour (Fig.5.)
6.	open the scope (ARMATURE CURRENT) which is highlighted in YELLOW colour (Fig.6.)

B) For Frictional load torque condition
1.	Open the simulation file SEPICFRICLT.slx through MATLAB
2.	Run the file for 11 seconds
3.	open the scope (COMBINED SPEED) which is highlighted in ORANGE colour (Fig.7.)

C) For Fan load torque condition
1.	Open the simulation file SEPICFANLT.slx through MATLAB
